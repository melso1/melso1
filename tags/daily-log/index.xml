I think a lot while I run. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any devices with me while I run other than my wristwatch which kind of forces my mind to wander.

        <description>My vocabulary of five letter words is improvingâ€”thanks to Wordle.
 I have to get better at thispowerlanguage.co.uk/wordle
  I was reading through Gergely Orosz&amp;rsquo;s article on &amp;ldquo;What Silicon Valley &amp;#39; Gets &amp;#39; about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not &amp;rdquo; and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but compare it to the Indian tech industry.
I have only worked at startups and whatever I know of the big Indian tech companies are from my friends and old classmates.</description>

        <description>I want to be the only person that does what I do.
As Dave Perell mentions in &amp;ldquo;Build a Personal Monopoly &amp;rdquo; a personal monopoly is a unique intersection of skills, interests, and personality traits.
This year, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore and redefine what my monopoly is and work towards building it through my blog and social media.</description>

        <description>I finished reading &amp;ldquo;The Defining Decade &amp;rdquo; by Meg Jay.
While deciding what to read next from my list of &amp;ldquo;Want to Read &amp;rdquo; books (it has 89 books now and it is not getting smaller), a random conversation with a friend led me to Haruki Murakami .
I have read Murakami&amp;rsquo;s works during the initial lockdown days.
I got interested in his writing through a collection of his short stories titled &amp;ldquo;The Elephant Vanishes&amp;rdquo;.</description>

        <description>The Coronavirus Omicron variant is hitting hard in India and I&amp;rsquo;m in its epicenter in Trivandrum.
These are uncertain times. The &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; normal is just the normal.
I live in campus with close to 200 people in the same building. Isolating a case of COVID is hard both from a social and a logistic perspective.
Half the people who get tested today in the district are positive.
So, here we are, uncertain, hoping for things to get better.</description>

        <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Wednesday my dudes!
I was working on the slides for two of my talks and realized how minimal they were.
I had made it a habit to make my slides into tools that just assists my presentation and not something that is overloaded with information.
This has proven to be much effective.
Human beings are bad at multitasking. You cannot focus your attention on two thingsâ€”listening to the person talking and trying to read their slides.</description>

        <description>I start off my &amp;ldquo;work day&amp;rdquo;â€”when I finish my morning routine and sit in front of my computer screenâ€”by catching up on some light reading.
I usually have a backlog I go to to start me off and I also have subscriptions to my favorite bloggers via email or RSS (yes I still use an RSS reader).
Most of what I read are from indie blogs I found through Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News or through aggregators like Blogging for Devs and daily.</description>

        <description>I have two upcoming talks in the next two weeks.
My firsts in 2022. And I hope to speak more at conferences this year.
The first is at DevConf.cz 2022 on the 29th this month and the second is at FOSDEM 2022 on the 5th of February .
Measuring Service Mesh Performance 101 This is my talk at DevConf.cz that dives into how the performance of a workload running on top of a service mesh can be benchmarked.</description>

        <description>I finished reading &amp;ldquo;The Psychology of Money &amp;rdquo; by Morgan Housel today.
It was a real page turner and I finished it in two sittings.
I am just starting another book on my Kindle, &amp;ldquo;The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter and How to Make the Most of Them Now &amp;rdquo; by Meg Jay .
It has been a while since I read ebooks and this should be a nice change of setting.</description>

        <description>I have a good excuse for why I missed my writing schedule the past two days.
I was in deep conversations.
I love talking to a person and engaging with them completely, taking the conversation to deeper levels.
I have been sleeping at ~4-5 AM everyday for the past week because of this. This has been a good change of pace to my normal life and it was much needed.</description>

        <guid>https://navendu.me/daily/11-1-22-task-tracking-setup/</guid>
        <description>A couple of months ago, my system to track tasks broke down.
The system was my own brain and depended on its ability to remember things. But it had this bug where it can only remember so many things before an incoming information pushes out &amp;ldquo;address the comments on the performance testing design spec&amp;rdquo;.
I had a physical book and Evernote to complement my ability to remember things but these didn&amp;rsquo;t make me more productive or make my life any easier.</description>

        <description>People are unable to predict their personal changes. We see ourselves as finished products at any point of time. Is that the end of history?</description>
